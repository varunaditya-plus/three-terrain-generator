# ThreeJS Terrain

This project is my **threejs terrain generator**, created with free polyhaven resources.

Created with the sole purpose to generate procedural terrain without a game engine, I made this entire</br>
project in React with ThreeJS to prove that you don't need a fancy game engine to make cool games.

<h2>✰ About</h2>
I started this project for my upcoming threejs game Blink, which is a game I am developing solely using my poor knowledge of Blender, free 3D models from sketchfab/polyhaven, and the concept of noise. This project has taught me how to create things like natural procedurally generating terrain using noise, camera shake, and fog. If you want to download and play around with this project, feel free! It's public so anyone can experiment with it.
